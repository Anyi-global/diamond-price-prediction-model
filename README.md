# diamond-price-prediction-model
This regression model was trained on Diamond dataset gotten from Kaggle. Four regression models (LinearRegression, KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor) were used to train this model, but RandomForestRegressor performed better on `Mean Absolute Error (MAE)` metric. Streamlit app was created for users to test this model live. This model will later be deployed online using streamlit cloud. Finally, this model can be integrated into the diamond industry to solve problems! <br>

The model and its corresponding notebook for the analysis can be found in this repo!
